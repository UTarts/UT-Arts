            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated: October 29, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the utstudio.in website (the "Service") operated by UT Arts ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h2>1. Services</h2>
            <p>UT Arts provides creative services including, but not limited to, Fine Art & Portraits (hand-drawn portraits), Digital Experiences (website design and development), and Visual Design (posters, social media graphics, etc.). All services are subject to a separate client agreement or contract which will be provided upon commissioning a project.</p>

            <h2>2. Inquiries and Quotes</h2>
            <p>All inquiries made through the Service (e.g., by clicking "Inquire Now" or "Get a Quote") are requests for information and pricing. They do not constitute a binding contract. A project is only considered "commissioned" after a formal agreement has been signed or an initial payment/deposit has been made as per an official invoice.</p>

            <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p><strong>Our Content:</strong> The Service and its original content (excluding content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of UT Arts. This includes all text, graphics, logos, and software. Our content may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of UT Arts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Client-Provided Content:</strong> You (the client) represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions for any materials you provide to us for a project (e.g., reference photos for a portrait, text and images for a website). You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use this content *solely* for the purpose of completing your project.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Deliverables & Portfolio Rights:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Fine Art & Design:</strong> Upon final payment, the client is granted ownership of the physical artwork or digital design files as specified in the project agreement. We (UT Arts) retain all copyrights to the work and the right to use images of the completed work for promotional purposes, including in our portfolio (on this website and on social media), unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Websites:</strong> Upon final payment, the client owns the completed website and its unique code. We retain the right to include a "Site by UT Arts" (or similar) credit in the website footer and to showcase the project in our portfolio.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>4. Payments and Refunds</h2>
            <p>Payment terms for all services will be detailed in a separate invoice or client agreement. Due to the custom, labor-intensive nature of our services (portraits, custom websites, designs), all sales are final. Deposits are non-refundable. We do not offer refunds once work on a project has begun.</p>

            <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

            <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>In no event shall UT Arts, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.</p>

            <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

            <h2>8. Changes</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page.</p>

            <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
